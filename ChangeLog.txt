		Make simcosts text larger
		Decimal points not being accepted at end of number for lat/long

0.4.0
		Reduced starting costs by 90% based on feedback
		Added % of initial ship cost to cost structure
		Added description to cfg file
		Added new cfg file for custom settings
		Added abililty to relocate running costs during sim, or not display altogether
		Added dialog to pause when ship lands
0.5.2
		Updated for 1.1
		Fixed bug where funds weren't being deducted at end of simulation from current funcs
0.5.3
		Added Changed estimated calcs of cost from Floor to Round, to 1 decimal place
0.5.4
		Added code to ensure that no latitude or longitude of 0.0 will be passed to Unity, this to work
		around a Unity bug.
0.5.5
		Added code to hide costs if UI is hidden
		Fixed issue when in career mode, if sim terminated in crash, unable to restart sim
		Fixed issu e where Flight results dialog would show up multiple times
0.5.6
		Added some code to check for a null value from the ProgressTracking when launching a sim
0.5.7
		Fixed issue where a ship could be recovered when landed, or return to space center when landed, and then 
		recover ship from space center.  Recovery tab disabled
0.5.8
		Fixed constant exceptions when in flight from KSP.UI.Screens.AltimeterSliderButtons.LateUpdate
0.5.9
		Fixed slowdown during simulation mode 
0.5.10
		Fixed bug where a ship too big or heavy for the launchpad/runway would be allowed to launch, but the game
		would then stop it, leaving the sim enabled until a real launch was done
		Fixed inability to hide sim costs during sim
		Fixed NullReferenceException when first opening a career game from the main menu
0.5.11
		Fixed issue where you couldn't start a sim in orbit or landed
0.5.12
		Fixed checks for size, mass & part count for orbital & landed sims to properly check against facility being used
0.5.13
		Fixed bug where ships length & width were being added together when checking for a ship too wide
		Added display of reasons for inability to start sim, along with the limit being exceeded
0.5.14
		Fixed exploding ships after teleport
0.5.15
		Fixed exploding ships after teleport to landed state
		Fixed issue where if flight can't be entered due to some reason, simulation mode will be exited.
			This can happen in the following two (known) scenarios:
				1.  Try to launch, no kerbals available, cancel launch
				2.  In career mode, if you try to simulate a vessel for which you haven't researched the parts, 
					the simulation does not start but the game remains in simulation mode. Obviously can happen only 
					if you import a ship design from another save. 
0.5.16
		The previous fix wasn't good, and it was still staying in sim mode, now fixed

0.5.17
		Added check for enough funds in Editor
		Now uses the MaxAllowableSimCost to set the initial default value

		Updated for 1.2
		New toolbar icon provided by @Three_Pounds, thanks
		Fixed bug where Career-Only: List of available alternative parent bodies comes up empty, despite having reached such a body (example: The Mun). 
		Fixed bug where Career-Only: When Terminate at SOI option is active in KRASH Config Window, Simulation is not terminated upon SOI switch to undiscovered body
		Fixed bug where Career-Only: When attempting to simulate a vessel that costs more than the current available funds, the simulation is not started giving an error message "Not enough Funds! You can't afford to launch the vessel." even though simulation costs could be paid for. "Simulation Active" is then stuck blinking on screen.
		Fixed bug where if the KRASHCustom.cfg was missing, the log would get spammed with missing messages while in the config screen

0.5.28
	Thanks to forum user @jebs_sy for this fix
		Fixed teleport position due to a change made in KSP in 1.3.1

		Rp-0 tooling integration
		Disable TestFlight during simulations
		Ignore RP-0 tooling costs in sim cost calculation
		Only update ship cost on editor modifications

	Removed Blizzy option from settings page
	Updated to latest ToolbarController, now registers with the toolbar

0.5.29.1
	Added dependency checking

0.5.29.2
	Version bump for 1.5 rebuild

0.5.26.1
	Rebuilt current version for 1.3.1, added compile-time var to avoid needing the ToolbarController or ClickthroughBlocker
	To recompile for 1.3.1:
		1. Add:  ;RP_1_131   to the Conditional Compilation Symbols to recompile for 1.3.1
		2. Update deploy.bat to copy to correct folder
		3. Update references to use a 1.3.1 install
		4. Remove references to the ToolbarController and ClickThroughFix from the References tab

0.5.30.1
	Thanks to @siimav for this:
		Check the unlock status of all parts before allowing to start a sim
		Previously the code only checked whether the tech for the part was researched but was missing the entry cost check. This had a nasty side effect of marking the current save as being a sim whereas the sim itself couldn't actually be started because stock VAB checks failed.
